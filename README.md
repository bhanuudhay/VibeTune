## Project Setup

To start using or contributing to the VibeTune project, follow the steps below to set it up locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine by downloading it directly from GitHub.

### 2. Install Dependencies
In the project directory, you will need to install the necessary dependencies to run the app. All dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file, and they will be installed when you open the project in your editor and follow the setup instructions in your environment.

### 3. Configure Your YouTube API Key
VibeTune requires a YouTube Data API key to fetch song data. To get an API key:
- Go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Create a new project or select an existing one.
- Enable the **YouTube Data API v3**.
- Go to the "Credentials" section and create a new API key.

After you get your API key, add it to the environment configuration so the app can authenticate with YouTube's servers. 

You can set up the key in a `.env` file located at the root of your project with the following variable:


### 4. Start the Development Server
Once you have all the dependencies installed and your API key configured, you can start the development server to run the app locally.

## Technologies Used

## How It Works

### Mood-Based Music Fetching
When the user selects a mood from a dropdown list (such as "Happy", "Sad", or "Relaxed"), the app sends a request to the YouTube Data API with a relevant query based on the selected mood.

For example:
- If the user selects "Happy," the query will be related to upbeat music.
- If the user selects "Sad," the app searches for sad songs.

Once the request is made, YouTube returns a list of videos matching the query. These videos are then displayed in the app, where the user can click on a song to open the video directly on YouTube.

### Randomized Song List
Each time a user selects a mood, the app fetches a new set of songs. This ensures the user gets a fresh experience every time, without repeating the same songs.

## API Integration

The app utilizes the **YouTube Data API** to fetch video details based on a search query. Here's how the integration works:

### Request Structure
- The request is sent to the following YouTube API endpoint:
